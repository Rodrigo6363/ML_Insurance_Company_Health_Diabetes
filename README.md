# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction Project (2017‚Äì2023)

This project explores and evaluates different machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals, using health-related data from **2017 to 2023**. The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable pipeline that can be applied to real-world clinical screening contexts.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **Data**: Preprocessed clinical and sociodemographic data.
- **Notebook**: Final pipeline including EDA, model training, evaluation, and comparison.
- **Figures**: All relevant visualizations and plots used for analysis and reporting.
- **Models**: Neural Network and best ML model saved for inference.
- **Utils**: Scripts used for visualizations and evaluations, used as a toolbox

## üßº Data Preprocessing

The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features such as:
- Age, Weight, Height, Cholesterol levels, HbA1c, Blood pressure.
- Socio-demographics: Gender, Race, Country of birth, Income group.
- Feature engineering: BMI, CHOL ratio, Risk indices.

Steps:
- Missing value handling.
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.
- Feature categorization (e.g., BMI categories, age groups).
- Train/test split.

## ü§ñ Model Training & Evaluation

### üß† Neural Network (Keras)

A feedforward neural network with:
- Dense layers + BatchNormalization + Dropout.
- Loss: Binary Crossentropy.
- Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall.

> Achieved high **recall (0.89)** but with lower **precision (0.40)**.

### üì¶ Machine Learning Models

Multiple models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation, including:
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.

### üìà Model Comparison (by Mean Recall)

## üìå Conclusions

- The **neural network** achieved **very high sensitivity**, ideal for screening use cases where missing a positive case is costly.
- The **machine learning models** (particularly Gradient Boosting and LightGBM) offered **more balanced performance**, with better precision and F1-score.
- Depending on the clinical goal (screening vs diagnosis), either model can be deployed.
